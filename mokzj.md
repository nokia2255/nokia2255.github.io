## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate individual with a love for gaming, problem-solving, and the ever-evolving world of coding. Let me share a bit more about the diverse facets of my interests and academic pursuits!

### Academic Explorer ðŸŽ“

I hold an MSc and BEng in Computer Science from The University of Edinburgh, with a focus on machine learning. My machine learning ventures extend to diverse projects, including but not limited to whatâ€™s shown below. My MSc dissertation delved into the practical application of game theory in financial systems, aiming to optimize clearing payments through established algorithms.

### Gaming Enthusiast ðŸŽ®

Whether itâ€™s navigating virtual worlds or strategizing in board games, I find joy in the challenges and excitement that games offer. Cryptid has currently claimed the title of my favorite board game, providing a perfect blend of strategy and intrigue. When not deciphering game mechanics, Iâ€™m immersed in the expansive landscapes of *Genshin Impact* and *Honor of Kings*, enjoying the unique experiences each game brings.

### Lofi Hip-Hop Connoisseur ðŸŽ¶

Amidst the code and challenges, I find solace in the soothing beats of lofi hip-hop. *Slipfunc*, *kudasaibeats*, *In Love with a Ghost*, *Monty Datta*, and *Shiloh Dynasty* are my go-to musical choices.
